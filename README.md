Courera Exploratory Data Analysis
Course Project 1

There are four R routines that produce 4 png graphs. The files for the graphs can be found in the repository alongside with the raw data.
The routines are named Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R

This is my own work and the routines run a bit slow.
